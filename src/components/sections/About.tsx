      <span className="text-amber-700">
        Recently graduated from a full-stack bootcamp, I'm eager to transition
        my career from a background in logistics to the dynamic world of web
        development and programming, where I'm experiencing the excitement of
        never-ending learning opportunities. As a dedicated team player with the
        ability to act and solve problems independently when needed, I'm ready
        to bring my skills and experience to the field of web development while
        also bringing value to the team. Currently developing my skills in
        React, TypeScript, and looking forward to learning Vue.js next.
